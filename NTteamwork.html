        <p><style><font><sans-serif></sans-serif></font></style> Hello, my English name is Phoebe. I'm living in Tra Vinh city, which is located in Southern of Vietnam. I'm in the last year of highschool, so i want to tell you something about my lovely school.</p>
         <p>My school is the best institution in our locality. Well qualified teachers are available in our school for all subjects. My school, not only teaches lessons in books, but also discipline and morality. We have separate sessions for moral values in my school. The best part of my school is the talent show that takes place every week. Students are allowed to exhibit their talents in front of everyone. Everyone should take part in this show. Due to such talent shows, my school has found out many young talents. My school has won the first place in interschool competitions.</p>

            <p>Hi there
I am Phuong Thanh
You can call me Petri. The name comes from the word “Petrichor”- the smell of earth after rain. I spend my spare time reading and chatting with my friends. It makes me feel relaxed and comfortable.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Vung Tau city which is located in the Southern part of Vietnam. It is a metropolitan area with millions of dwellers. As a matter of fact, I believe it is one of the Vietnamese cities that best matches many travellers’ ideas of what Vietnam is like.
It has beautiful beaches, fully invested infrastructure.The puddles are well planned, adorned with straight paths, trees, beautiful beaches, graceful slopes full of flowers.
It is so fascinating for visitors that Vung Tau as lively and as vibrant as the typical image of a tourist centre of antiquity, but there are moments of calm and quiet in the street. It is these things that make the roadstead so fascinating that it remains a constant attraction for exploration and return of visitors.</p>
